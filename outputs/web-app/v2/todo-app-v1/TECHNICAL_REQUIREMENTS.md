# Todo App v1 Technical Requirements

## 1. Introduction

The Todo App v1 is a sophisticated single-page application designed to manage workflow-based tasks through a conversational interface. The application features a step-by-step progression system that guides users through various sections and steps of a workflow, allowing them to interact with AI agents for each step.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Frontend Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **State Management**: React Query and local state hooks
- **Routing**: React Router
- **API Communication**: Fetch API

### 2.2 Component Structure

The application follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **App**: Main application container providing routing and global providers
2. **Pages**:

   - `Index`: Main workflow page
   - `NotFound`: 404 error page

3. **Core Components**:

   - `WorkflowHeader`: Displays the current workflow title and navigation
   - `StepList`: Shows the list of sections and steps with their current states
   - `StepItem`: Individual step component with state indicators
   - `ChatInterface`: Conversational interface for interacting with agents

4. **UI Components**:
   - A comprehensive set of reusable UI components from Shadcn UI library

## 3. Data Models

### 3.1 Workflow Model

```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  sections: Section[];
}

interface Section {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  steps: Step[];
}

interface Step {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  sectionId: string;
  agentId: string;
}
```

### 3.2 User Progress Model

```typescript
interface UserProgress {
  userId?: string;
  workflowId: string;
  startedAt: string;
  lastUpdated: string;
  steps: Record<string, StepProgress>;
  metadata?: {
    deviceInfo?: string;
    userAgent?: string;
    sessionId?: string;
  };
}

interface StepProgress {
  stepId: string;
  sectionId: string;
  agentId: string;
  state: StepState;
  conversationData?: ConversationData;
  lastUpdated: string;
}

type StepState =
  | "not_started"
  | "in_progress"
  | "started"
  | "complete"
  | "error";
```

### 3.3 Conversation Model

```typescript
interface ConversationData {
  conversationId?: string;
  startTime?: string;
  endTime?: string;
  messages?: Array<{
    role: "user" | "assistant";
    content: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
  audioSegments?: Array<{
    id: string;
    duration: number;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
  userResponses?: Array<{
    question: string;
    response: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>;
}
```

## 4. Core Features
