# Kid Story Builder - Interactive Quest Map UI

Create a vibrant, kid-friendly React web application that serves as an interactive quest map for children (ages 8-12) to create their own stories through voice chat. This should be a pure UI/state management app without any backend functionality.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

**Visual Style:**

- Fun, cartoony, and captivating design inspired by Cocomelon
- Bright, cheerful colors that appeal to kids aged 8-12
- Quest map layout where users journey from area to area
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Use TailwindCSS for styling

**Quest Map Layout:**

- Render the workflow as an adventure map with different themed areas
- Each group becomes a visually distinct "area" on the map
- Each step within a group becomes a "quest" within that area
- Show a clear path connecting all areas and quests
- Display the workflow name prominently (e.g., "Character Creation Quiz")
- Include a child avatar character that moves along the quest path
- Position the avatar at the current active step location
- **3D Environment Features** (if using Three.js):
  - Isometric or third-person perspective quest map
  - 3D terrain with different biomes for each area (magical forest, castle, etc.)
  - Volumetric lighting and atmospheric effects
  - 3D avatar with walk cycles and idle animations
- **2D Environment Features** (if using Pixi.js or CSS):
  - Top-down or side-scrolling map perspective
  - Layered parallax backgrounds for depth
  - Rich sprite animations and particle effects
  - Smooth camera following and area transitions

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality

**Step States & Visual Indicators:**
Each step must visually represent one of these states:

- `not_started`: Initial state (grayed out or locked appearance)
- `in_progress`: Currently active step (glowing, highlighted, animated)
- `started`: Previously worked on but incomplete (partially filled/colored)
- `complete`: Finished step (bright colors, checkmark, celebration indicator)
- `error`: Technical error state (red indicator, warning icon)

**Interaction Rules:**

- Only one step can be `in_progress` at a time
- Users can click to reactivate any `started` or `complete` step
- Users cannot activate `not_started` steps (they must be sequential)
- Clicking an available step changes it to `in_progress`

**Animations:**

- Cute, kid-friendly animations when a step starts
- Celebration animation when a step completes
- Smooth transitions between states
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Avatar walking animation when moving between quests
- Avatar idle animations while at a quest location
- Helper companion floating/bouncing animations
- **Area introduction animations**: Helper companion gets excited and shows speech bubble when entering new areas
- Companion attention-getting animations (gentle pulse, wave) when providing guidance

3. **Help Companion**: Always-present helper character that provides assistance and area explanations
4. **Guided Experience**: Automatic area introductions and contextual help from the companion
5. **State Management**: Proper handling of step states and transitions
6. **Progress Tracking**: Multiple levels of progress indicators
7. **Interactive Elements**: Clickable steps with proper state validation
8. **Animation System**: Engaging animations for avatars, state changes, and interactions
9. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface optimized for mobile devices

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Create a single-page React application that displays this interactive quest map with avatar characters. Focus on creating an engaging, kid-friendly UI with smooth character animations and delightful interactions using your chosen gaming engine. The app should feel like a real adventure game where kids are excited to guide their avatar through each step of their story creation journey.

**Recommended Setup Process:**

1. Initialize React project with TypeScript support
2. Install chosen gaming engine (Three.js + React Three Fiber for 3D, or Pixi.js for 2D)
3. Set up TailwindCSS for UI styling
4. Create basic 3D/2D scene with simple environment
5. Implement avatar character with basic animations
6. Build quest map layout with themed areas
7. Add state management for step progression
8. Implement helper companion with area explanations
9. Polish with particles, lighting, and sound effects

The child avatar should serve as the player's representation in this quest world, making the experience personal and engaging. The helper companion should feel like a trustworthy friend who's always there to help when needed.

Remember: This is a UI-only application with no backend functionality. All interactions should be handled through local state management, with special attention to avatar positioning and movement animations that correspond to the user's progress through the quest. The gaming engine should create an immersive, game-like experience that captivates children and makes story creation feel like play.
