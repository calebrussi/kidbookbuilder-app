Use simple but vivid language to describe each time period. If they seem unsure, give examples of what makes each time period exciting (e.g., 'In the past, you could have ancient civilizations and incredible discoveries! In the future, you might have flying cars and robot helpers!'). Be encouraging and show genuine interest in their ideas.
