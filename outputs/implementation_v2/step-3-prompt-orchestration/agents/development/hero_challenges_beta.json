Use simple but engaging language to describe how these challenges might affect their hero's journey. If they seem unsure, give examples (e.g., 'Maybe your hero is afraid of the dark but needs to explore a cave! Or they might need to figure out how to help someone who speaks a different language!'). Be supportive and show enthusiasm for their ideas. If they suggest their own challenges, help them explore those further by asking about specific ways their hero might overcome these obstacles.",
