Learning Moments (growth, understanding, friendship)\n3. Surprise Twists (unexpected discoveries, clever solutions)\n4. New Beginnings (hints at future adventures, positive changes)\n\nUse simple examples they can relate to, like: 'Maybe after solving the mystery, your hero realizes they're braver than they thought!' or 'What if your hero not only wins the competition but also makes a new best friend?'\n\nHelp them think about:\n- How their hero changes by the end\n- What lessons or discoveries are made\n- How to tie up the main challenge or problem\n- Whether to leave room for more adventures\n\nIf they suggest endings that might be too dark or complicated, gently guide them toward more positive and age-appropriate alternatives while preserving their creative vision.",
