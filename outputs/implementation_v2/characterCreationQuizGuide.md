# Character Creation Quiz Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation guide focuses on building the interactive voice chatbot experience for the character creation quiz component. The quiz is designed to engage children in a natural conversation that helps shape their storytelling journey through a series of guided questions and responses.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Voice Recognition Infrastructure

### Steps

1. Configure Eleven Labs API Conversational AI integration

   - Create a simple websocket connection with 11L
     - https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/quickstart
   - Craete a simple ReactJS app using a websocket connection with 11L
     - https://elevenlabs.io/docs/conversational-ai/guides/quickstarts/next-js
   - Persist the messages sent and received to a JSON file
     - NOTE: the messages are sent/received client-side via WS. You'll need to create an Express API with an endpoint to receive the messages. Then write the files to JSON from server-side.

2. Figure out how to organize question prompts.
   - Manually create an 11L agent based on a node in the user flow.
   - Create a JSON file with all the nodes in the user flow.
   - Create an instructional prompt that converts the node text into an 11L agent prompt.
   - Create a simple API integration with 11L to CRUD agents.
   - Sync the agent prompts in the JSON file with 11L.
   - Prompt Orchestration (sequencing of sequential and dependent prompt nodes)
     - Implement state machine for prompt flow
     - Build prompt queue manager

### Expected Outcomes

- Working voice recognition system that can:
  - Process children's speech with >90% accuracy
  - Ask defined questions in a defined sequence
  - Provide real-time feedback within 500ms
  - Output a structured document with answers to the questions
- Complete API documentation including:
  - Authentication setup guide
  - Endpoint specifications
  - Error codes and handling
  - Rate limiting details
- MongoDB schemas and indexes defined
- Prompt management system with:
  - CRUD API documentation
  - JSON schema validation
  - Flow orchestration diagrams
  - Cache implementation details

### Verification Process

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:eleven-labs": "Test Conversational AI WebSocket connection and streaming",
    "verify:prompt-storage": "Validate MongoDB operations and caching",
    "test:prompt-flow": "Verify prompt orchestration and dependencies",
    "validate:speech": "Test speech recognition accuracy",
    "benchmark:latency": "Measure real-time feedback performance"
  }
}
```

## Technical Stack Requirements

### Frontend

  - Support for major browsers
  - Fallback options for older browsers
- Canvas/WebGL for visual representations
  - Hardware acceleration support
  - Progressive enhancement
- WebAudio API for voice processing
  - Real-time audio processing
  - Buffer management

### Backend

- Node.js/Express for API
  - TypeScript implementation
  - RESTful API design
  - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- MongoDB for data storage
  - Mongoose ODM
  - Indexing strategy
  - Caching layer
- WebSocket for real-time communication
  - Socket.io implementation
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Connection management

### APIs & Services

- Eleven Labs API with Conversational AI
  - WebSocket-based real-time conversations
  - Streaming audio responses
  - Auto-detected conversation turns
  - Connection state management
  - Conversation history tracking
  - Voice customization and cloning
  - Automatic speech detection
  - Error handling and reconnection logic

## Development Guidelines

1. Each phase should be developed in isolation

   - Independent git branches for each phase
   - Self-contained dependencies
   - Isolated testing environment
   - No shared utilities between phases

2. All components must be tested with actual children's voice samples

   - Minimum 100 test samples per age group
   - Various accents and speech patterns
   - Different environmental conditions
   - Edge case handling

3. Security and privacy measures must be implemented for voice data

   - End-to-end encryption
   - Data retention policies
   - COPPA compliance
   - Audit logging

4. Performance optimization for real-time voice processing

   - Maximum 500ms latency
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - CPU utilization tracking
   - Network bandwidth optimization

5. Accessibility features must be included in each component

   - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Color contrast requirements

6. Cross-browser compatibility must be maintained
   - Support latest 2 versions of major browsers
   - Progressive enhancement strategy
   - Fallback implementations
   - Responsive design principles

## Note

This implementation guide focuses on creating a technically sound and child-friendly voice interaction system. Each component is designed to be built and tested in isolation, with clear verification steps and measurable outcomes. The development process prioritizes discovering and solving technical challenges independently before integration. All scripts and tests are designed to be self-contained and runnable via package.json commands, with results persisted to disk for verification.
