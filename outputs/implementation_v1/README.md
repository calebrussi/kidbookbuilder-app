# Kid Book Builder

A platform that helps parents and children create and publish stories, podcasts, and videos.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into separate phases, each focusing on specific technical challenges:

- **Phase 1**: Environment Setup & Configuration âœ…
- **Phase 2**: Core Infrastructure Development âœ…
- **Phase 3**: Primary Feature Implementation âœ…
- **Phase 4**: Secondary Feature Implementation ðŸ”„
- **Phase 5**: Integration & System Assembly

Each phase is contained in its own directory within `outputs/v_2/phases` with minimal dependencies between phases.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the phase you're working on (`outputs/v_2/phases/phase#`)
2. Follow the setup instructions in the phase's README.md file
3. Run the verification scripts to ensure proper configuration

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Configuration

The foundation phase establishes the development environment and basic infrastructure:

- Project structure setup
- Development environment configuration
- Storage integration
- Basic authentication

### Running Phase 1

```bash
# Verify environment setup
npm run verify-phase1

# Start development servers (API and client)
npm run dev:phase1

# Test storage and authentication
npm run test-storage
npm run test-auth
```

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Development

This phase implements the core infrastructure components:

- User management
- Content storage
- Publishing workflows
- API integration

### Running Phase 2

```bash
# Verify environment setup
npm run verify-phase2

# Start development servers (API and client)
npm run dev:phase2
```

The client application will be available at http://localhost:3001, and the API at http://localhost:3000.

## Phase 3: Primary Feature Implementation

The current active phase focuses on building the primary features that make the Kid Book Builder platform valuable to users:

- **Story Generation Tools**: Assistance tools for creating and structuring stories
- **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time collaborative editing for family members
- **Media Integration**: Tools for adding illustrations, audio recordings, and videos
- **Template System**: Story templates and themes for quick starts
- **Feedback System**: Age-appropriate feedback and suggestions for improvement

### Running Phase 3

```bash
# Verify environment setup
npm run verify-phase3

# Start development servers (API and client)
npm run dev:phase3

# Run tests for Phase 3
npm run test:phase3
```

The client application will be available at http://localhost:3002, and the API at http://localhost:3000.

## Phase 4: Secondary Feature Implementation

The next phase will implement additional features to enhance the user experience:

- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights into content engagement
- **Export System**: Tools for exporting stories in various formats
- **Sharing Platform**: Capabilities for sharing content
- **Accessibility Features**: Ensuring content is accessible to all users

## Development Philosophy

- Each phase is completely self-contained
- Only minimum code needed is scaffolded for each phase
- Technical discovery and problem-solving take priority over comprehensive architecture
- Components will be assembled into a cohesive application later
