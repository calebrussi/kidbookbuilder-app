- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for client-side interaction

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure environment variables (see `docs/environment.md`)
3. Run verification scripts: `npm run verify-phase2`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev:phase2`

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the patterns established in Phase 1
- Write unit tests for all core components
- Document API endpoints using OpenAPI specification
- Ensure all components have proper error handling
