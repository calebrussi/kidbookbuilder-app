# Web Application Backstory Creation Prompt

This is an interactive, iterative process for creating a compelling `backstory.md` document about your web application. The process involves a series of questions and answers in the chat window to gather all relevant information about the problem space, solution, and target users before drafting the backstory.

_IMPORTANT_ Throughout the process, capture the details of the iterative chat—including questions, answers, and key insights—in the `backstory.md` document from the beginning. This ensures transparency and provides context for the solution development.

Follow these steps:

1. At the start of the process, create the `backstory.md` file in the `outputs` folder within the project directory. This file will be updated throughout the process to capture all details, including the iterative chat, problem analysis, and solution development.

2. Through an engaging chat conversation, explore and document the origin story of the application idea:

   - The moment or experience that sparked the initial idea
   - Personal experiences with the problem being solved
   - Key insights or "aha moments" that shaped the solution
   - Evolution of the concept over time
   - Vision for how this solution will impact users' lives
     Document this origin story in the `backstory.md` file as it unfolds in the conversation.

3. Using insights from the origin story, refine and expand the understanding of the problem space. For each aspect below, start with relevant details from the origin story and explore further:

   - Core problem or pain point: Build upon the personal experiences shared in the origin story
   - User challenges: Expand from the initial problem that sparked the idea
   - Value proposition: Derive from the key insights and "aha moments" mentioned
   - Target users: Identify who else might share similar experiences to those in the origin story
   - User journey: Map how the solution evolved to address the discovered pain points

4. Build an outline of the problem space, including:

   - Context of the problem
   - User pain points and unmet needs
   - Impact of these challenges on users
   - Opportunities for positive change

5. Create detailed profiles of ideal customer personas, including:

   - Demographics and psychographics
   - Goals and motivations
   - Current frustrations and challenges
   - Decision-making factors
   - Usage scenarios and contexts

6. Present both the problem space analysis and customer profiles to the user for review and approval. Iterate as needed until the user agrees that the information is comprehensive and accurate.

7. Once the user approves the analysis, craft a compelling narrative that:

   - Tells the story of the problem discovery
   - Introduces the target users and their challenges
   - Explains the journey to the solution
   - Highlights the unique value proposition
   - Paints a vision of the transformed user experience

8. Identify key messaging themes and value propositions that can be referenced throughout the website, and confirm these with the user.

9. Present the draft backstory to the user for feedback. Iterate on the draft, asking additional questions if necessary, until the user is satisfied with the result.

The goal is to collaboratively produce a backstory that clearly communicates the problem being solved, resonates with target users, and sets a compelling foundation for the web application's marketing and user experience.
