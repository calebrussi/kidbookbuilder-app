# Business Requirements Document Creation

## Instructions

1. Read the contents of `reqs/start.md` to understand the initial project concept.

2. Create a new business requirements document in the `reqs` folder named `busReq.md`.

3. Work through the requirements gathering process step-by-step, focusing on one section at a time:
   - Problem Statement: What specific problem is being solved?
   - Target Users: Who is the solution being created for?
   - Value Proposition: Why is solving this problem important?
   - Core Functionality: What features are needed to solve the problem?
   - User Interface Requirements: What user experience is needed?
   - Success Criteria: How will we know if the solution is successful?

4. For each section:
   - Ask specific questions to gather missing information
   - Present the current section draft for feedback
   - Make refinements based on user input before moving to the next section

5. Important guidelines:
   - Do NOT generate the entire document at once
   - Acknowledge when the initial information is incomplete
   - Use the chat to guide the information gathering process
   - Seek clarification on ambiguous requirements
   - Validate each section with the user before proceeding

6. Keep requirements focused on WHAT is needed, not HOW to implement it:
   - Focus on business needs and user goals
   - Avoid technical implementation details (no specific programming languages, frameworks, database types, etc.)
   - If the user provides technical details, politely explain the difference between requirements and implementation
   - Guide users new to requirements documentation by providing examples of properly worded requirements
   - Explain that separating requirements from implementation details allows for better solution design later

7. The business requirements document must explicitly answer these fundamental questions:
   - What specific problem is being solved?
   - Who is the solution being created for? (detailed user profiles)
   - Why is solving this problem important? (value proposition)
   - How will we know if the solution is successful? (success criteria)

8. After gathering all requirements, organize the information into a coherent document with clear sections and formatting.

9. Present the final document for approval and make any requested adjustments.

The goal is to create a thorough business requirements document through collaborative conversation, not to generate assumptions about what the user wants.
