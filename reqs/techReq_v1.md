# Kid Book Builder: Technical Requirements

## Step 1: Core Workflow

### Driving Question
Walk me through the main user workflow from start to finish - what does a typical user session look like?

### User Response
The typical user session follows these steps:
1. User logs into the system
2. User selects or creates a project to work on
3. Within the project, user develops the story using AI chatbot assistance
4. After completing the story arc, user transitions to book writing phase with AI support

### Technical Requirements
1. Authentication System
   - Secure login/session management
   - Role-based access control (child/parent accounts)
   - Session persistence and token management

2. Project Management
   - Database schema for projects and stories
   - Project state management system
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Project versioning and history

3. AI Integration Layer
   - Real-time AI chat interface
   - Context management for story progression
   - Story arc validation and tracking
   - Natural language processing for story development
   - Specialized AI prompts for children's storytelling

4. Content Creation System
   - Story arc template engine
   - Draft management system
   - Content versioning
   - Format conversion pipeline (text to book layout)

### Implementation Notes
- Use JWT for authentication with secure refresh token rotation
- Implement WebSocket for real-time AI chat functionality
- Maintain conversation context through session storage
- Implement progressive auto-save to prevent loss of work
- Design child-friendly UI components for all interaction points
- Structure AI prompts to guide story development in age-appropriate way

## Step 2: Integration Needs

### Driving Question
What external services or platforms does this system need to interact with?

### User Response
The primary external integration needed is a Large Language Model (LLM) service for the AI chatbot functionality, with potential for additional integrations in the future.

### Technical Requirements
1. LLM Integration
   - API integration layer for LLM service
   - Custom prompt engineering system for storytelling
   - Response streaming capability
   - Context management for maintaining story coherence
   - Error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Rate limiting and usage monitoring
   - Cost optimization strategies

2. Infrastructure for Future Integrations
   - Modular integration architecture
   - Standardized API gateway
   - Authentication middleware
   - Service registry for future platform additions

### Implementation Notes
- Design abstraction layer to allow switching between different LLM providers
- Implement caching system for common LLM responses
- Set up monitoring for LLM usage and performance
- Create structured prompt templates for consistent story guidance
- Build retry mechanisms for API failures
- Implement proper error handling for degraded service

## Step 3: Technical Foundation

### Driving Question
What are your main technical priorities for this system?

### User Response
The main technical priorities are:
1. Simple and easy-to-use AI systems
2. AI that enhances and builds upon children's creativity
3. Easy-to-navigate platform interface

### Technical Requirements
1. AI System Architecture
   - Simplified AI interaction layer
   - Context-aware response generation
   - Child-friendly language processing
   - Creative suggestion engine
   - Adaptive conversation flow
   - Real-time story enhancement features

2. User Interface Framework
   - Intuitive navigation system
   - Age-appropriate UI components
   - Progressive disclosure of features
   - Visual storytelling aids
   - Responsive design for various devices
   - Accessibility-first approach

3. Creative Enhancement System
   - Story element suggestion engine
   - Character development assistance
   - Plot progression tracking
   - Interactive storytelling prompts
   - Creative writing templates
   - Dynamic story visualization

### Implementation Notes
- Implement AI responses with appropriate reading level detection
- Design conversation flows that encourage creativity rather than replace it
- Create visual cues and helpers for navigation
- Build interactive elements that maintain engagement
- Ensure all AI interactions preserve the child's original ideas
- Develop clear and consistent navigation patterns
- Structure the platform to grow with the user's abilities
