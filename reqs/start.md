a kid book builder app
kids are super creative, we want to capture that creativity
outputs should be a book we can put on amazon, an audio book we can put on  spotify and videos we can put on youtube
the story capture process should be voice and should follow hollywood best practices on crafting compelling stories
it should be an ongoing activity where the kid creates episodes on a weekly basis
add some sort of leaderboard or gameification to it
