# Kid Book Builder: Technical Requirements

## Step 1: Core Workflow

### User Response
Based on the business requirements, a typical user session involves:
- Child initiates a storytelling session through voice recording
- System provides story structure guidance
- Content is processed and converted into multiple formats
- Progress is tracked and gamification elements are updated
- Parents review and manage publishing permissions
- Stories are published to selected platforms

### Technical Requirements
1. User Authentication & Management
   - Multi-user system with parent/child account relationships
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for parent oversight
   - Secure authentication system with age-appropriate login methods

2. Content Creation Pipeline
   - Voice recording system with noise reduction
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for speech-to-text conversion
   - Story structure template engine
   - Multi-format content converter (text, audio, video)
   - Content versioning and draft management

3. Data Models
   ```
   User {
     id: UUID
     role: enum[child, parent]
     profile: UserProfile
     stories: Story[]
     achievements: Achievement[]
   }

   Story {
     id: UUID
     author: User
     title: string
     episodes: Episode[]
     status: enum[draft, review, published]
     publishedFormats: Format[]
   }

   Episode {
     id: UUID
     storyId: UUID
     audioRecording: Blob
     transcription: string
     structure: StoryStructure
     version: number
   }
   ```

### Implementation Notes
